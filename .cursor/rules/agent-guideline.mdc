# Agent rule

- The project overview is described in [README.md](mdc:README.md).
- Generate code/comment in **English**.
- When you find something to improve, stop and give advices to user instead of continuing generation.
- Use python as the main script language.
- All actions are done in docker container. The host machine only executes sh file to toggle action through docker.
