# PR Analysis Script Improvement Record

## Improvement Overview

We have made improvements to the PR analysis script in three main areas:
1. **Model Parameter Optimization**: Dynamically adjust LLM API parameters based on PR complexity
2. **Content Quality Enhancement**: Enhance prompt templates to provide deeper technical analysis
3. **Visualization Element Support**: Added support for ASCII charts and tables

## 1. Model Parameter Optimization

### Implemented Features
- Added `calculate_pr_complexity` function that calculates PR complexity based on the following factors:
  - Number of file changes
  - Total lines of code changed
  - Number of comments
  - Description length
- Dynamically adjust the following parameters based on complexity:
  - `max_tokens`: More tokens for complex PRs (up to 8000)
  - `temperature`: Lower temperature (0.2) for complex PRs to get more deterministic results
  - `top_p`: Adjust sampling strategy based on complexity
  - `frequency_penalty`: Increase vocabulary diversity for complex PRs

### Effects
- Higher creativity (temperature=0.4) for simple PRs
- More tokens and more deterministic output for complex PRs
- Output complexity score and parameters used in the console for debugging

## 2. Content Quality Enhancement

### Improved Prompt Template
- **Technical Analysis** section:
  - Added specific analysis of code patterns and algorithm changes
  - Request specific code examples to explain the principles of changes
  - Added code quality improvements or potential issues analysis
  - Added dependency analysis and risk rating (high/medium/low)
  - Added performance impact assessment
- **Context Insights** section:
  - Request specific technical debt references
  - Added specific optimization suggestions
  - Analysis of design pattern usage and architectural impact
- **Knowledge Background** section:
  - Added brief descriptions of related PRs/issues
  - Added external resource context
  - Added related best practices
- **Review Summary** section:
  - Highlight unresolved issues or concerns
  - Record consensus points among reviewers

## 3. Visualization Element Support

### Added Features
- Added "Visual Representation" section supporting the following visualization elements:
  - Simple architecture diagrams showing affected components
  - Logic change flowcharts
  - API change comparison tables
  - Dependency graphs
- Provided ASCII flowchart examples as reference
- Added table formatting guidance

### Effects
- Generated reports now include API change comparison tables
- Include dependency graphs showing affected components
- Create simple but effective visualizations using ASCII characters

## Test Results

We analyzed Bevy engine's PR #18084 using the improved script, with the following results:
- Complexity score: 0 (this is a relatively simple PR)
- Parameters used: max_tokens=4000, temperature=0.4, top_p=0.9
- Generated report contains deeper technical analysis
- Successfully added API change comparison table and dependency graph
- Report structure is clearer with richer content

## Future Improvement Directions

1. **More Precise Complexity Calculation**:
   - Consider semantic complexity of code changes
   - Analyze core parts of the codebase involved in the PR

2. **More Visualization Options**:
   - Support Mermaid chart syntax
   - Add code change heat maps

3. **Multi-Model Collaboration**:
   - Use one model for preliminary analysis
   - Use another model for in-depth analysis and visualization

4. **Adaptive Prompts**:
   - Adjust prompts based on PR type (feature, bug fix, refactoring, etc.)
   - Provide different depth of analysis guidance for PRs of different complexity
